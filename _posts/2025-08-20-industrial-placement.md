## Introduction

Last year I completed a technical industrial placement with CGI, a technical consulting and IT solutions company. I completed this in between my third year and forth year of my Integrated Masters Course at the University of Warwick. I was the only one in my year doing this path so was initially hesitant but this placement provided an invaluable opportunity to gain hands-on experience across a wide range of technical and consulting responsibilities providing me with a new skill set that I can take into my masters year. During this time, I was involved in several different client-facing and internal projects, expanded my technical understanding and contributed to projects where I was able to clearly see the value that I added. This report outlines my key experiences, the skills I developed, the challenges I encountered and how this placement has helped me put the skills I have learnt during my degree into practice. 

## Placement Role and Company Overview

CGI is a global IT and business consulting services company that provides end-to-end solutions across various sectors. My role focused on software engineering within the delivery team in the Energy and Transformation Sector, though I was also exposed to research, design and architecture activities. What made this experience especially unique was the variety of projects I worked on and the real responsibility I was given from the outset. I was able to contribute meaningfully across different workstreams, while being supported by colleagues, mentors and my designated buddy.

## Key Projects and Contributions

Throughout my placement, I was involved in four major projects, the work spanned traditional software development, solution architecture, AI research, operational tooling and internal engagements.

One of my most technically challenging contributions involved building a dead letter recovery tool for Azure Service Bus. This tool was developed to assist a service team in identifying and recovering failed messages efficiently. The development involved understanding Azure messaging infrastructure, implementing robust .NET logic and validating the tool through testing. Since this tool was for a high-stakes project, the requirements of the tool were continuously evolving, which required flexibility and a clear understanding of the scope of the tool.

In another stream of work, I helped develop and demonstrate internal automation solutions. These included proof-of-concept applications aimed at improving delivery and operational excellence, one of the core CGI values. I was responsible not only for coding and debugging, but also for conceptualising and presenting these ideas to internal stakeholders, prioritising ideas based on their impact and value add. These experiences taught me how to translate technical concepts into value-driven narratives that would benefit the internal efficiencies of the team and wider business unit. As a part of the Operational Excellence automation initiative, I took on a leadership role in organising and running a sector-wide Generative AI hackathon. This was part of a broader AI adoption initiative and involved planning and delivering a one-day interactive learning session. The aim was to help colleagues across the sector build confidence in using Generative AI tools, collaborate on innovative ideas and create practical use cases they could take back into their day-to-day roles. Leading this event not only developed my communication and leadership skills but also deepened my knowledge of generative AI technologies and their real-world applications.

I also contributed to shorter, more technical projects during my time at CGI. One of these involved working with the Sustainability team to convert an existing Python proof-of-concept web application into a production-ready solution using Java and React. Initially the only technical person on the project, I took on a wide range of responsibilities including solution design, backend and frontend development and onboarding new developers as the project grew. This experience helped me build confidence in working across the full stack and taking ownership of a project’s technical direction.

Another key project I was a part of was a data validation solution for a client in the utilities sector. The work focused on digitalising engineering drawings that required extensive validation and structure. Acting as the technical lead, I worked directly with the client to define requirements, propose solutions and provide realistic estimations for feature complexity and delivery timelines. This project gave me direct experience in client communication, solution planning and balancing technical feasibility with business needs.

These varied experiences allowed me to develop a broad skill set, adapt to new technical challenges and contribute meaningfully to projects that had both internal and client-facing impact.

## Skills Developed

The placement year was a valuable opportunity that significantly enhanced both my technical abilities and professional skills, providing hands-on experience in a real-world environment.

Over the course of the year, I developed strong proficiency in C# and .NET development, gaining confidence in writing, testing and maintaining high-quality code. I worked extensively with Microsoft Azure services to build and test cloud-native tools, which deepened my understanding of cloud computing and its practical applications. I was also introduced to solution design and architecture, giving me insight into how large-scale systems are planned and structured. Additionally, I gained experience with APIs, service integrations and messaging platforms, which helped me understand how systems communicate and exchange data.

Beyond that, I expanded my technical skill set by working on full-stack development using Java and React as part of a sustainability-focused project. Starting as the sole developer, I was responsible for designing the solution, building both the backend and frontend,and later onboarding and supporting additional developers. I also acted as the technical lead on a data validation project for a client, where I helped digitalise complex engineering drawings. This involved designing a tailored solution, estimating development effort and complexity and communicating regularly with the client to refine requirements. These projects strengthened my ability to manage end-to-end delivery and take ownership of both technical decisions and stakeholder relationships.

Towards the end of the placement, I began exploring Generative AI tools and frameworks, which sparked my interest in how emerging technologies can be applied to real-world problems.

On the professional side, I developed strong project management skills by balancing responsibilities across multiple concurrent projects. I improved my ability to communicate clearly and present information effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. I also had the opportunity to take the lead on initiatives, such as coordinating an internal AI hackathon, which helped build my leadership and organisational skills. Working within cross-functional teams taught me the importance of collaboration and adaptability, particularly in dynamic project environments where priorities can shift quickly. Overall, I became more confident in managing my time, handling competing demands and adjusting to new challenges as they arose.

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges I faced was juggling multiple projects at once, often with overlapping deadlines and competing priorities. This sometimes made it difficult to dedicate focused time to technical tasks, especially on days filled with meetings. To manage this, I developed a system of clearly blocking focus time in my calendar and aligning with team leads to clarify task priorities.

Another challenge was adjusting to very different working styles across projects. Each team had its own structure, communication preferences and development processes. While this was initially difficult to navigate, it ultimately helped me build adaptability and exposed me to different models of collaboration and delivery.

## Integration and Engagement

From the beginning of my placement, I made a conscious effort to engage with others across the company. I regularly worked from both the Solihull and London offices, allowing me to meet colleagues from various business units. This networking helped build a strong sense of belonging and ensured I had a broad support network to rely on when facing challenges.

The company’s buddy system was a particularly helpful aspect of the onboarding process. My buddy took the time to understand my interests and actively helped me get placed on relevant and exciting projects. I also took part in inter-office and social events, which helped me feel more integrated into the wider CGI community.

## Reflections on Learning and Growth

This placement year has exceeded my expectations. While I initially anticipated a role focused purely on software development, I’ve instead had a dynamic experience that included development, design, architecture, research and leadership. I’ve grown in confidence, improved my technical capabilities and become much more comfortable working in a fast-paced, professional environment.

One of the most rewarding aspects has been seeing the real-world impact of my work. Whether it was through tools used in critical operations or the AI hackathon that inspired new ideas across the sector, I felt like I was genuinely adding value.

I've also gained a clearer sense of my career interests. While I’ve enjoyed technical development, I’m particularly interested in roles that combine technology with consulting and problem-solving. This is an area I hope to explore further as I continue my studies and career.

## **Conclusion**

This industrial placement year has been an incredibly valuable experience. Initially, I wasn’t sure if it was the right move as I was the only one in my year doing this but once I started, I realised that the majority of the other Graduates had previously completed a placement either at CGI or elsewhere. I’ve had the chance to work on impactful projects, develop new skills and grow both personally and professionally. I’ve gained insight into how large-scale IT projects are delivered, developed strong working relationships and explored areas of interest that I hadn’t anticipated.

Most importantly, I’ve discovered the value of taking initiative, staying curious and being adaptable, qualities that I believe will serve me well throughout the rest of my academic and professional journey. I’m extremely grateful for the support and opportunities I’ve received during my time at CGI and look forward to applying what I’ve learned in the future.
