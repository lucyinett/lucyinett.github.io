### Introduction

Hello, and welcome to my portfolio blog.  

I’ve created this space as a way to share my experiences in the tech industry and reflect on the lessons I’ve learned along the way. Over time, I’ve found that writing is not only a powerful tool for documenting ideas, but also for starting conversations and building connections with others who may be navigating similar paths.  

A key focus of this blog will be women in tech. Representation and inclusion in our field are topics that matter deeply to me, both from my own perspective and from what I’ve witnessed in the industry at large. By sharing stories and insights, I hope to contribute to a broader dialogue—one that celebrates progress, but also acknowledges the challenges that remain.  

By way of introduction: I am currently studying for an integrated master’s degree at the University of Warwick, and I recently completed a placement year that gave me valuable industry experience. My interests lie in artificial intelligence and automation—particularly how these technologies can be used thoughtfully and responsibly to make our lives easier.  

Beyond that, I’ll be writing about the tech industry more generally: the changes I see, the trends I find interesting, and the issues that impact those of us who work in this space. My aim is not to provide all the answers, but to reflect, question, and learn openly.  

This is the beginning of that journey, and I’m excited to see where it leads.
